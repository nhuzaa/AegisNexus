# Aegis Nexus

Welcome aboard the **Aegis Nexus Shuttle**, where we boldly go where no infrastructure team has gone before! ðŸš€

## ðŸŒŒ Overview

**Aegis Nexus** is an AI-powered multi-agent platform designed to transform your infrastructure management experience. Whether you're a CTO juggling Kubernetes dashboards or a CIO navigating compliance challenges, Aegis Nexus is your mission control for achieving zero-gravity peace of mind in your digital universe.

The backend follows a multi-step pipeline to transform a user question into actionable SRE insights. The high-level flow is:

![Aegis Nexus Processing Flow](backend/docs/image/flow.png)

1. **Question** â€“ The user submits a question through the API or CLI.
2. **Determine suitable action** â€“ The SRE agent analyzes the question to figure out what data is needed.
3. **Select tools (LangGraph)** â€“ Using LangGraph, the agent chooses which monitoring tools or PromQL queries to use.
4. **Generate PromQL** â€“ The agent formulates specific PromQL queries to retrieve metrics.
5. **Run tools** â€“ Prometheus and other tools execute the queries and gather logs/metrics.
6. **Process logs and metrics** â€“ Results are parsed and condensed into a technical summary.
7. **Summarize** â€“ The LLM service provides a short natural language answer based on the technical findings.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**
  - FastAPI and LangGraph-based Python project managed with UV.
  - Includes agents, tools, and services for processing user questions and generating actionable SRE insights.

- **Frontend**
  - Next.js-based Vibe-coded interface.
  - Provides a modern and interactive user experience.

- **Demo Grafana Prometheus**
  - Chaos engineering project.
  - Generates logs using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Litmus.
  - Kubernetes integration is a work in progress (WIP).

- **Litmus Chaos Test**
  - Focuses on chaos engineering experiments using Litmus.
  - Tests system resilience and generates chaos scenarios.


## Installation

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- uv (install with: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

### Setup
To set up the project, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sre-agent-api
uv sync
```

## Usage

### FastAPI Server
To run the FastAPI application:

```bash
# Development mode (with auto-reload)
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Production mode
uv run uvicorn app.main:app
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Endpoints

#### Ask SRE Questions
Send a POST request to the `/sre/ask` endpoint:

```json
{
  "question": "What is the role of an SRE?"
}
```

#### Other Endpoints
- `POST /sre/incident-response` - Trigger incident response workflow
- `GET /sre/health` - Get system health report
- `GET /sre/tools/demo` - Run SRE tools demo
- `GET /sre/tools/health` - Check SRE tools health

### Command Line Interface

The CLI supports multiple commands for interacting with the SRE agent:

#### Using UV Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# Ask a question
uv run cli -q "What is the current CPU usage?"

# Or using the alias
uv run sre-cli -q "What is the current CPU usage?"

# Get system health report
uv run cli --health

# Run SRE tools demo
uv run cli --demo

# Check tools health
uv run cli --tools-health

# Trigger incident response
uv run cli --incident "HighCPU" "critical"

# Use a different agent
uv run cli -a sre -q "Show me recent alerts"
```

#### Using Direct Python Command
```bash
# Ask a question
uv run python cli.py -q "What is the current CPU usage?"

# Get system health report
uv run python cli.py --health

# Run SRE tools demo
uv run python cli.py --demo

# Check tools health
uv run python cli.py --tools-health

# Trigger incident response
uv run python cli.py --incident "HighCPU" "critical"
```

### CLI Commands Reference

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `-q, --question` | Ask a question to the SRE agent | `uv run cli -q "What is SRE?"` |
| `-a, --agent` | Specify agent type (default: sre_agent) | `uv run cli -a sre -q "hello"` |
| `--health` | Get comprehensive system health report | `uv run cli --health` |
| `--demo` | Run SRE tools demonstration | `uv run cli --demo` |
| `--tools-health` | Check health status of all SRE tools | `uv run cli --tools-health` |
| `--incident` | Trigger incident response workflow | `uv run cli --incident "AlertName" "severity"` |

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_sre_agent.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v
```

### Adding Dependencies
```bash
# Add production dependency
uv add package-name

# Add development dependency
uv add --dev package-name
```

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file:

```bash
# Copy example file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit with your actual API keys
LANGGRAPH_API_URL=your_langgraph_api_url_here
LANGGRAPH_API_KEY=your_langgraph_api_key_here
LLAMA_API_KEY=your_llama_api_key_here
```
